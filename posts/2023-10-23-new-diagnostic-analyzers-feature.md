Stride continues to evolve, adding new utilities and features every week. This blog post will cover the newly added `DiagnosticAnalyzer` feature in `Stride.Core.CompilerServices`.

## What is a `DiagnosticAnalyzer`?

A `DiagnosticAnalyzer` is a feature from Roslyn that scans your code while you are typing in your IDE. C# also utilizes this feature; every time you see a warning or red squiggly lines in your IDE, a `DiagnosticAnalyzer` gets triggered. Importantly, this analysis has nothing to do with telemetry.

## What does it do?

The new `Diagnostics` primarily focus on [Serialization](https://doc.stride3d.net/latest/en/manual/scripts/serialization.html). These analyzers generate warnings for code that is incompatible with [Stride's Serialization Rules of Thumb](https://doc.stride3d.net/latest/en/manual/scripts/serialization.html#rule-of-thumb).

Each error code follows this format: `STRDIAGXXX`, where 'X' represents a numerical digit. Clicking on these error codes will open a help page that explains in depth why the `DiagnosticAnalyzer` was triggered and how to resolve the warning. You can find these error code pages [here](https://doc.stride3d.net/latest/en/diagnostics/).

## Why use it?

This feature aims to minimize those "Why is my property not showing up in the [Game Studio](https://doc.stride3d.net/latest/en/manual/game-studio/index.html)?" moments. It's often unclear why certain properties don't appear in the editor. These analyzers are designed to clarify such situations, aiding your development process in Stride.

## Current State

The pull request (PR) to introduce these analyzers has been merged. However, there hasn't been a release that includes them yet. If you're eager to test them out, you can build the engine from the source. Otherwise, you'll have to wait for the next release of Stride's NuGet packages.

## For Engine Developers

Adding new analyzers to the Stride engine is straightforward. However, be aware that Visual Studio (VS) has a bug caused by .NET, which makes VS load Roslyn only once at startup. To work around this, compile `Stride.Core.CompilerServices` and restart VS after adding a new analyzer.

## Summary

This is a new quality-of-life feature that simplifies development in Stride by providing immediate feedback on coding issues.
