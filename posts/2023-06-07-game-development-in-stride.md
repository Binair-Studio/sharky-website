A little reminder that Stride has been presented in a .NET live! 

ðŸŽ¥ðŸŽ¥ðŸŽ¥

Vaclav, Tebjan and I have participated in a .NET live session to showcase the Stride engine as well as some work done by users, many questions were asked and many were answered !

## The most important questions answered

In this live we've answered the most important questions about the project, how to use Stride and what it aims to be!

Tebjan has presented a bit about what contributors have done, what users (professionals/hobbyist, artists/developers) have done so far to show off the capabilities of the enginen, well as a little presentation of how Stride is used with VVVV with 3D rendering!

## A fun experimentation

Vaclav has dived into Stride wanting to use Stride without editor, creating an API to experiment and create games just with a nuget package.
In his part, he presents his nuget package, how to use it and to make games using the power of .NET and hot reloading!

## Shaders

I've myself gotten interested in the shader system of Stride and found it refreshingly easy to use. I decided to show more of how to use shaders, update them and extend the rendering engine of Stride.


## Closing

We hope watching this live can help you have a better understanding of Stride. .NET is becoming more and more relevant for a game engine as we can see with Stride, don't hesitate to reach our community through the discord server!
