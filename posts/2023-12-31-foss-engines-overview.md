There is no better way to describe the landscape of premium proprietary software than "the party is over." As companies re-evaluate their payment models, those dependent on their software must decide between accepting the price increases or considering alternatives. The video game industry is no exception to this changing tide as major game engine developers explore new ways to monetize their users. While there is never an opportune time to deal with these pricing changes, the rise of free and open-source game engines over the past decade has finally allowed independent game developers to consider free software for their next project.

## What is FOSS, and why should I use a FOSS game engine?

As the name suggests, free and open-source software (FOSS) includes two significant characteristics: it is free (libre), and its source code is readily available. Free (or libre) software can be used for any purpose at the user's sole discretion. In other words, the user has complete control over the software. The open-source aspect of FOSS describes how everyone has access to the code that makes up the software.

With this in mind, using a FOSS game engine provides several advantages. First and foremost, no licensing fees. While contributors always appreciate donations, none of the notable FOSS game engines expect or require any upfront payment, monthly subscriptions, or ongoing royalties. To that end, FOSS engines provide independence from a single organization. If any changes are made to a FOSS engine's terms of use, its licensing terms allow the community to stick to the version with the most favorable terms and fork off it if they so choose.

The community guides the development and growth of their FOSS engine of choice. Many FOSS game engines have active and passionate communities who share their knowledge, advocate for their engine, and help out newcomers. These vibrant and dedicated communities serve as a potent learning resource when working solo or as a small team. Some community members even contribute directly to their engine, ultimately improving the quality of the engine for everyone. 

The "open source" in FOSS means game engines can be entirely modified to fit the needs of the team or project. For example, if the engine lacks a specific feature, has a persistent bug, or needs quality-of-life improvements, anyone can freely modify it as they see fit. They can even take the additional step of contributing the changes to the project for everyone's benefit. FOSS game engines depend on their community to mature and grow.

## What FOSS game engines are available today?

Although FOSS game engines have been around for decades, the past several years have seen an explosion in the number of game engines available, as well as the amount of contributors, money, and resources dedicated to them. It would be impossible to cover all the FOSS game engines available now. If you have a passion for a particular language or framework, more likely than not, someone has some form of game engine written for it. 

This post will primarily focus on some of the most significant and notable FOSS game engines currently: Bevy, Godot, Open 3D Engine, and (of course) Stride. To celebrate the wider FOSS game development community, this will not be a comparison post of the different engines. Instead, it will serve as an overview of each engine's notable features.
